# Environment Variables

Wybra reads environment variables through the central configuration service.
Environment values override application configuration for fields that declare an
environment override.

Secret-store keys are not environment variable names. Keychain, Vault, KMS, and
other secret-source keys are ordinary configured strings and may use application
specific paths such as `secrets/key/dev/current` or
`auth/forms/csrf-token-secret/dev/current`.

Default keychain keys are:

| Name | Key | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `secret` | `secrets/key/current` | Current system secret-envelope key material. |
| `secret-prev` | `secrets/key/previous` | Previous system secret-envelope key material used during rotation. |
| `csrf` | `auth/forms/csrf-token-secret/current` | Current forms CSRF token signing secret. |
| `csrf-prev` | `auth/forms/csrf-token-secret/previous` | Previous forms CSRF token signing secrets used during rotation. |
| `google` | `auth/providers/google/client-secret` | Google OAuth client secret. |
| `github` | `auth/providers/github/client-secret` | GitHub OAuth client secret. |
| `apple` | `auth/providers/apple/private-key` | Apple Sign in private key. |

Development deployments should override those defaults to development-scoped
keys such as `secrets/key/dev/current`,
`auth/forms/csrf-token-secret/dev/current`, and
`auth/providers/google/dev/client-secret` when a shared operator keychain also
contains production values.

## Secrets And Key Material

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `WYBRA_SECRET_KEY` | Environment fallback for the system secret-envelope key material used by Wybra encryption helpers and cookie-backed sessions. This is a single fallback value and is not automatically rotated. Use keychain-backed `[secrets.crypto]` storage for current/previous rotation. |
| `CSRF_SECRET_KEY` | Environment fallback for the forms CSRF token signing secret. A configured keychain CSRF secret takes precedence when it resolves successfully. |
| `CSRF_SECURE` | Boolean override for the CSRF cookie `Secure` flag. This is not secret key material. |

Configured secret-source keys may also point at environment variables:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Configured `[secrets.crypto].current_key` | When `[secrets.crypto].source = "environment"`, this names the environment variable that contains current system secret-key material. If omitted with environment source, Wybra uses `WYBRA_SECRET_KEY`. |
| Configured `[secrets.crypto].previous_keys` | When explicitly configured with environment source, this names the environment variable containing comma-separated previous system secret-key material. Rotation is not automatic for environment values. |
| Configured provider `client_secret_key` | When an OAuth provider has `secrets = "environment"`, this names the environment variable containing the provider client secret. |
| Configured Apple `private_key_secret_key` | When Apple auth has `secrets = "environment"`, this names the environment variable containing the Apple private key. |
| Configured database credential keys | When `[app.database].credential_source = "environment"`, `user_key`, `password_key`, `sa_user_key`, and `sa_password_key` name the environment variables that contain database credentials. |
| Arbitrary environment secret keys | The `environment` secret source can resolve any configured key from the process environment. |

## Application Startup
