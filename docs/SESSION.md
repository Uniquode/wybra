# Session Configuration

Wybra installs its own session middleware as core application infrastructure.
Applications and Wybra modules use the standard `request.session` value; do not
also install Starlette `SessionMiddleware`.

Sessions are used for short-lived request state such as queued alerts. They are
separate from authentication tokens and do not replace login, MFA, or account
verification policy.

## Storage Backend

Local deployments default to cookie storage when no backend is configured:

```toml
[app]
deployment_environment = "local"
```

For staging and production, configure a backend explicitly:

```toml
[app]
deployment_environment = "production"

[wybra.sessions]
storage_backend = "database"
```

Supported values are:

- `cookie`: encrypted and signed cookie storage for small session payloads.
- `memory`: in-process storage for local development only. Sessions are lost on
  restart and are not shared between workers.
- `file`: server-side session files under a configured directory.
- `cache`: Redis-compatible cache storage.
- `database`: durable Tortoise-backed storage.

## Recommended Production Backends

Use `database` when the application already has a database and session durability
matters:

```toml
[wybra.sessions]
storage_backend = "database"
database_connection_name = "default"
```

Wybra includes the lightweight session table migration in the application
migration graph as core infrastructure. This keeps switching to the `database`
backend operationally straightforward later, even when a deployment currently
uses another backend.

Use `cache` when Redis or a compatible cache is the operational session store:

```toml
[wybra.sessions]
storage_backend = "cache"
cache_url = "redis://localhost:6379/0"
cache_key_prefix = "wybra:sessions:"
```

Use `file` only when a single host or shared filesystem is appropriate:

```toml
[wybra.sessions]
storage_backend = "file"
file_directory = ".wybra/sessions"
```

Use `cookie` only for small, non-sensitive payloads that can safely travel with
each request:

```toml
[wybra.sessions]
storage_backend = "cookie"
cookie_payload_max_bytes = 3800
```

Cookie storage uses Wybra's secret-envelope key material. Configure
`WYBRA_SECRET_KEY_CURRENT` and, during rotation, `WYBRA_SECRET_KEYS_PREVIOUS`.
See [`SECRET_KEY.md`](SECRET_KEY.md) and
[`SECRET_ROTATION.md`](SECRET_ROTATION.md).

For local unconfigured deployments, Wybra generates process-local cookie
encryption material. Local session cookies therefore do not survive application
restarts unless you configure `WYBRA_SECRET_KEY_CURRENT`.

## Lifetime And Cookie Settings

The default session lifetime is 14 days. Configure it in seconds:

```toml
[wybra.sessions]
lifetime_seconds = 1209600
```

Cookie settings can also be adjusted:

```toml
[wybra.sessions]
cookie_name = "wybra_session"
cookie_path = "/"
cookie_domain = "example.com"
cookie_secure = true
cookie_same_site = "lax"
```

If `cookie_secure` is not configured, Wybra uses insecure cookies only for the
`local` deployment environment and secure cookies elsewhere.

## Payload Limits

Wybra validates stored session payloads as JSON-serialisable mappings and
rejects oversized payloads.

```toml
[wybra.sessions]
payload_max_bytes = 65536
cookie_payload_max_bytes = 3800
```

`payload_max_bytes` applies to server-side storage. `cookie_payload_max_bytes`
applies to the final encrypted cookie value for the `cookie` backend.

## Validation

Run:

```sh
uv run wybra-validate sessions
```

Full validation also includes sessions because they are core infrastructure:

```sh
uv run wybra-validate
```

## Custom Session Storage

Applications with specialised storage requirements may provide a compatible
session storage implementation during site setup. The replacement storage must
support asynchronous `load`, `save`, `delete`, `validate`, `cleanup`, and
`close` operations and must preserve Wybra's serialisable session data and
lifecycle metadata contract.

Request handlers and modules still use `request.session`; storage details should
not be exposed to page, API, or alert code.
